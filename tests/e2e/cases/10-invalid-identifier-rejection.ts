/**
 * Invalid SQL identifier rejection — RELEASE_CHECKLIST §2 + §5.
 *
 * Hivemind reads `HIVEMIND_SESSIONS_TABLE` / `HIVEMIND_MEMORY_TABLE` from
 * the environment and interpolates them directly into SQL. Without
 * `sqlIdent()` validation, a malicious operator (or a config-injection
 * attack via env var manipulation) could land an attacker-controlled
 * fragment inside a DDL/DML statement.
 *
 * The defense is `sqlIdent(name)` — throws on anything outside
 * `[A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_]*`. Bug class to catch: a future code path
 * forgets the guard and interpolates a user-controlled name directly.
 *
 * Case sets `HIVEMIND_SESSIONS_TABLE=bad-name-with-dashes` in the agent's
 * environment + a unique sentinel marker prompt. After the run, the
 * assertion verifies:
 *   - the sessions table named `bad-name-with-dashes` does NOT exist
 *     in the e2e workspace (sqlIdent rejected before any CREATE)
 *   - the legitimate sessions table also did NOT get a row with the
 *     sentinel (the rejected install/capture flow shouldn't have run)
 *
 * Install-only via the spawn path: we set the env var on the agent
 * spawn (not on install). For agents whose capture hooks run their
 * own checks, this triggers their reject path.
