/**
 * Wiki worker happy path: session ends → worker spawns → memory row lands.
 *
 * The wiki worker generates a session summary by running the agent's CLI
 * with a summarization prompt against the captured session rows, then
 * INSERTs the produced text into the `memory` table. This case asserts
 * that one full round-trip produces a memory row tagged with the
 * session's id.
 *
 * Coverage gap closed: case 12 (recursion-guard) tests that the worker
 * short-circuits when HIVEMIND_WIKI_WORKER=1 is in env, but the happy
 * path — worker spawns, runs, writes — has no case. A regression that
 * makes the worker silently produce nothing (e.g. a gate prompt change
 * that returns no JSON, an INSERT shape mismatch) wouldn't surface in
 * the existing matrix.
 *
 * The wiki worker is async and runs DETACHED from session-end. We give
 * it a wall-clock budget via the case's timeout (90s default) for the
 * LLM call + INSERT to complete. A faster CI would shorten this; for
 * a manual matrix run, 90s is fine.
 *
 * Skipped on openclaw — its summary path is different (in-band wiki via
 * a different code path, not the session-end subprocess pattern).
