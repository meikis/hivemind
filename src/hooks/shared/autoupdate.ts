/**
 * Shared autoupdate helper for session-start hooks.
 *
 * One source of truth: the npm package `@deeplake/hivemind`.
 * One mechanism: the `hivemind update` CLI, the same command users run
 * manually. Session-start is just the *trigger*.
 *
 * Replaces the divergent legacy paths:
 *   - Claude Code:   `claude plugin update hivemind@hivemind --scope X`
 *                    against marketplace + GitHub raw `package.json`
 *   - Codex:         `git clone --branch v<latest>` + cp into ~/.codex/hivemind
 *                    against GitHub raw `package.json`
 *   - OpenClaw:      ClawHub registry version check + advice text
 *
 * Cursor / Hermes / pi previously had no autoupdate at all; they pick it
 * up for free here.
 *
 * ## Hot-path constraint: NEVER block session-start
 *
 * Real-world testing 2026-05-06 surfaced a destructive bug: an awaited
 * `hivemind update` spawn added 3-5s latency to every session start (the
 * spawned process always fetches the npm registry, ~500ms typical, up to
 * 3s+ on slow links). User flagged "destructive". Hard rule: no awaited
 * spawns, no awaited fetches, on the session-start hot path.
 *
 * Implementation: fire-and-forget detached spawn. The hook returns
 * immediately (sub-50ms). The spawned `hivemind update` process runs
 * fully detached (`child.unref()`) and survives the parent's exit. The
 * upgrade outcome is delivered on the NEXT session start, when
 * `getInstalledVersion()` reads the freshly-upgraded plugin.json.
 *
 * The lock that prevents concurrent `hivemind update` runs no longer
 * lives here (we'd release it instantly after dispatching, defeating
 * its purpose). Follow-up: move it into `src/cli/update.ts:runUpdate()`
 * so the long-running update process owns the lock for its lifetime.
 *
 * ## No cache (intentional, per review)
 *
 * Earlier drafts of this helper had a 4h "last-checked" cache to avoid
 * firing the spawn on every session-start. Reviewer feedback (efenocchi,
 * 2026-05-07): in the worst case "we publish a new release at 13:01,
 * users who started a session at 13:00 don't pick it up until 17:00."
 * That's an unacceptable UX paper cut for a small background-CPU win
 * (the cache was only saving an npm registry GET + version compare in
 * the spawned process — it never affected session-start latency, since
 * the dispatch is detached either way).
 *
 * So the cache is gone. Every session-start fires the detached spawn.
 * The detached `hivemind update` checks npm itself; if up-to-date it
 * exits silently. Trade-off accepted: more npm registry GETs (1 per
 * session-start instead of 1 per 4h), in exchange for ~zero "miss new
 * release" window. Concurrent invocations are serialized by the
 * follow-up flock in `runUpdate()` (see PR #97 review thread).
